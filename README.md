How to use

> 1. Download this repository as .zip file, unzip it to a folder, open *WorldPlantInvasion.Rproj* with Rstudio, then the R project will open.
> 2. Open *analyses.qmd*, you will find all the code used to run SEMs. Do not run the models unless you are doing it on a server, and note that it takes days to finish.
> 3. Open *figures.qmd*, you will find all the code to reproduce figures. Note that I used Adobe Illustrator to generate Fig.1, Fig.3 and Fig.S4. I also used the software to refine PDFs generated by R.
